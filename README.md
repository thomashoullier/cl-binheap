# Binary Heap Common Lisp implementation
This is an implementation of a binary heap in Common Lisp.

## Implementation details
I wrote this as a CLOS class. Using the binary heap object is really straightforward. Please see the file `example.lisp` for detailed examples. This was tested using SBCL 1.4.4.

## Contact
If you are an experienced Lisper happening to have stumbled across this repository and if you have time, then I would greatly appreciate feedback (see email on my profile) on anything at all: coding practices, corrections and optimizations etc.
